      <h4>CONS OF TECHNOLOGY</h4>
      <p >                           <!-- inline CSS -->
        As these technological systems are designed by humans and have revolved so constantly that 
        every youths today have built a deeply-rooted connection with technology and they are 
        inseparable from technology. Today's youths seems to be vanished in the world of technology and 
        seems to be unaware about the things happening in the real life. However, today's generation are spending
        more of their time on screen rather than off-screen.It is good to know about technology and using it for
        essential tasks, but when it is overused or misused it is little unacceptable. Hence, technology has caused
        negative impact in the human life. The access to online social media platforms has minimized actual 
        face-to-face social interaction which has resulted in lack of social skills in today's generation.
        Lastly, technology creates unstable mindset causing depressing attitude and decreasing human creativity.
        Overall, there are pros and cons in equal proportion.</p>
