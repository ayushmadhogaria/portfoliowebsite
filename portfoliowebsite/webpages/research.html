        <p>This webpage is the homepage of the portfolio website that I have designed.
            This page, basically is meant to give the slight concept about other overall 
            webpages. I took the reference for this page from a general portfolio website to 
            basically just gain clear idea about how homepages are designed. After researching
            various websites, this website seemed to be good for me as it used basic HTML codes
            and it was easy and simple to design.
            Here, the navigation bar is kept at the rightmost corner with proper spacing to
            show the hover effect and help the user to know about which webpage has been 
            selected. Similarly, I kept the name at the topmost left corner to indicate the 
            main background of the website. In my case, it is a portfolio website so I have 
            written my name on the top. Similarly, in the centre of the homepage I have kept 
            a button to switch directly to the next page. So, these were the overall 
            components of design that I took as a reference for my homepage. The navigation 
            area was created with nav tag and the showcase area was made with header tag
            and few basic CSS components.</p>

         <p>This webpage is the Curriculam Vitae(CV) page of the portfolio website that I have designed.
            This page, basically is meant to give the overall information about a person's biodata 
            that can be used by a company incase they want to hire anyone. 
            I took the reference for this page from a general portfolio website to 
            basically just gain clear idea about how CVs are designed. After researching
            various websites, this website seemed to be good for me as it used basic HTML codes
            and it was easy and simple to design.
             Here, the CV is made by dividing a box into two different boxes. The left box
            contains the image of the person on the topmost corner. Below it there are basic
            information about a person. Similarly,the right side of the box contains all the 
            major information about the person. The main thing that I took as a reference is
            the part where skills are provided in the form of rating meter. This concept was
            unique and innovative. This design was made with the help of basic CSS tags where
            first a border was designed and later, different border with different radius 
            was designed which overlapped the first box.</p>
