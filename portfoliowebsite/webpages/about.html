          <h3> Something <span class="text-primary"> About Myself</span></h3>
          <p class="lead"> On the first impression, I may come across as quite as an
             ambivert, but trust me, provided the opportunity, I've got  a lot to offer. 
             Whether that's intellectual ponderings or amiable conversations,will not just
             listen attentively to what you say, but also agree or refute an equable poise. 
             Although not prominent to all, you can have a crack at my quirky sense of humour. 
             I have served in the field of IT in various organizations where I worked in different 
             positions. </p>
          <p class="lead">Personally the field of Information Technology has helped me in exploring the 
              world of technology, and working in this field for past few years has boosted
              my confidence and this field has given me a brilliant range of knowledge. For
              the young intern, who want to be successful in this field ,I suggest them to work as an intern 
              in many companies as possible as it helps to build a good concept about this field and also
              help to broden the critical analysis skills.</p>
          <p class="lead">Here, this website is a portfolio website which contains all of my major information
              so that, it can be used by you to hire me for any job related in the field of information
              technology and further enquiry can be done with the help of the contact form present in the 
              rightmost corner of the navigation bar.</p>
